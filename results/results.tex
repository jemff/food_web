\section{Results}
We study a tri-trophic system over a period of time from spring to fall, in order to capture the seasonal variations in population levels and vertical migrations. We restrict ourselves to a single seasonal cycle so we do not have to take the radically changed resource dynamics during winter into account, and can avoid questions of hibernation and other seasonal adaptations for low-resource environments. We compare three different cases of behavioral optimization: Full rationality, ($\sigma = 0 m^2$), bounded rationality ($\sigma = 10 m^2$), and a fully irrational system with a uniform distribution throughout the water column $(\sigma = \infty m^2)$ as a reference. The system with a uniform distribution reduces our dynamic to Lotka-Volterra dynamics and is included as a reference system, to showcase the dynamics without behavior.

\subsection*{Population dynamics}

\label{fig:long_term_populations}
\end{figure}
\Cref{fig:long_term_populations} shows the seasonal-term population dynamics for the system we consider, comparing the population levels for the models with complete rationality (\Cref{fig:long_term_populations}(A)), bounded rationality (\Cref{fig:long_term_populations}(B)) and full irrationality (\Cref{fig:long_term_populations}(C)).\todo{Forklar hvorfor du inddrager fuld irrationalitet.}

In the system with full irrationality \Cref{fig:long_term_populations}(C) we see very unstable population dynamics, with the consumer population crashing and the predator population in the middle of a crash at the end of the simulation. In contrast, both bounded and full rationality result in stable population dynamics (\Cref{fig:long_term_populations}(A,B)). All three models have an initial large population growth, but the behavioral optimization rapidly dampens the population dynamics, as the increase in predator populations leads to a corresponding decrease in the willingness of consumers to take risks (\Cref{fig:long_term_populations}(A,B)). The population levels for the model with bounded and full rationality are essentially indistinguishable, so the decrease in fitness from the decrease in optimality is not that great. Viewed on a long time-scale the underlying daily variation is practially invisible.
% The resources reach a stable level quickly in all three cases, but the populations of consumers and predators differ markedly. The difference in populations between the system with bounded rationality \Cref{fig:long_term_populations}(2) and the fully rational system appears to be negligible, \Cref{fig:long_term_populations}(1). The main driver of the change in population dynamics seems to be the ability to retreat to a refuge, and not the exact shape of the distributions when interacting.

\subsection*{Bounded rationality and complete rationality}
\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{plots/both_specific_dists.pdf}
\caption{Daily distribution of consumers \emph{blue} and predators \emph{red} at noon \emph{(A,D)}, dusk \emph{(B,E)} and at midnight, \emph{(C,F)} with full (A-C) and bounded rationality (D-F) on the 22nd June (Summer solstice)}

\label{fig:both_specific_dists}
\end{figure}
The plots in \Cref{fig:both_specific_dists} show snapshots of consumer and predator distributions in the water column at dawn, midday and dusk on summer solstice. $\Cref{fig:both_specific_dists} (A-C)$ shows the distributions with full rationality, and $\Cref{fig:both_specific_dists} (D-F)$ show the migration with bounded rationality. Any significant differences in behavioral choices between our model of bounded rationality and full rationality become visible when viewing the resulting distributions simultaneously. As expected, a pattern of vertical migration emerges with the emergence of a deep scattering layer of fully rational consumers at noon \Cref{fig:both_specific_dists}(A, blue). Most of the predators are also present in this layer \Cref{fig:both_specific_dists}(A, red), excepting a few hanging out higher in the water column deterring upward consumer migration, corresponding to the modelling results of \citep{jerome}. At dusk, \Cref{fig:both_specific_dists}(B) the predators have a greater concentration near the surface, while the consumer "box" is begining to form, yet still with a continuous drop-off to the surface due to the risk from the light. At midnight \Cref{fig:both_specific_dists}(C) the consumers are concentrated near the surface, with a discontinuous drop to nothing. The predators follow the consumers, albeit with a continuous shape, both distributions being similar to the results of \citep{verticalmigration}.


The behavioral choices with bounded and full rationality are strikingly similar, especially at noon (\Cref{fig:specific_dists_rational}(A, D)). At dusk a the consumers with full rationality have a large discontinuous peak in their distribution, which declines continuously towards the top of the water column due to the risk from light (\Cref{fig:specific_dists_rational}(B, blue)), while the consumers with bounded rationality follow the same pattern of moving towards the surface, but are more evenly spread out (\Cref{fig:specific_dists_rational}(E, blue)). Predators with full and bounded rationality have almost the same distribution at dusk (\Cref{fig:specific_dists_rational}(B, E, red)), though the distribution of consumers is qualitatively quite different. The increased consumer numbers at the top must be balanced by by the higher peak at the bottom of the consumer distribution at the bottom of their range for the predators with bounded rationality, in order for them to achieve uniform fitness with almost the same distribution as those with full rationality.
At midnight the distribution of fully rational consumers has a discontinuous dropoff (\Cref{fig:both_specific_dists}(C, blue)). Due to the forced dispersion, the consumers with bounded rationality are more spread out (\Cref{fig:both_specific_dists}(F,blue)), but the distribution looks like a smoothed version of the fully rational distribution.
In contrast to the consumers, the fully rational predators and the predators with bounded rationality have almost the same distribution, where they spread out at night, with the highest concentration in the top of the water column (\Cref{fig:both_specific_dists}(C, red)).

%As both predators and consumers follow the Nash equilibrium strategy, their fitness is identical at the various points in the water column due to the behavioral choices.


%At noon, \Cref{fig:both_specific_dists}(A) the consumers form a deep scattering layer, where most of the predators are also present. excepting a few hanging out higher in the water column deterring upward consumer migration \Cref{fig:specific_dists_rational}(1)(15 m), corresponding to the modelling results of \citep{jerome}.

%At dusk, \Cref{fig:both_specific_dists}(B) the predators have a greater concentration near the surface, while the consumer "box" is begining to form, yet still with a continuous drop-off to the surface due to the risk from the light. At midnight \Cref{fig:both_specific_dists}(C) the consumers are concentrated near the surface, with a discontinuous drop to nothing. The predators follow the consumers, albeit with a continuous shape, both distributions being similar to the results of \citep{verticalmigration}.

%Examining the migration in the ecosystem with bounded rationality, \Cref{fig:specific_dists_irrational}(D-F), we see roughly the same picture as in \Cref{fig:specific_dists_rational}(A-C). The greatest difference is at midnight and dusk, \Cref{fig:specific_dists_irrational}(B,E,C,F), where the bounded rationality leads to a smooth shape for the distrbution of consumers. At noon, the distributions in the system with bounded rationality \Cref{fig:specific_dists_irrational}(D) and perfect rationality \Cref{fig:specific_dists_rational}(A) are almost entirely equal.

\subsection*{Seasonal variation}
\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{plots/total_heatmap.pdf}
\caption{Vertical distribution of consumers \emph{(A-C)} and predators \emph{(D-F)} at spring equinox (March 22), summer solstice (June 22) and fall equinox (September 23)}
\label{fig:heatmap_total}
\end{figure}
The heatmaps in \Cref{fig:heatmap_total} illustrate the seasonal variation of the daily migration of consumers (\Cref{fig:heatmap_total}(A-C)) and predators (\Cref{fig:heatmap_total}(D-F)), by focusing on the equinoxes and the summer solstice.
%To understand the migration in greater detail, we look at the complete migration picture.
The vertical migration (\Cref{fig:heatmap_total}) is apparent throughout the seasons. Both consumers and predators are highly concentrated at the top of the water column during nighttime, and at day they scatter to the deep. The pattern of the predators \Cref{heatmap_total}(D-F) is slightly different from the consumer pattern, \Cref{fig:heatmap_total} (A-C). At nighttime there is still a non-zero concentration of predators in the upper layers of the water-column, there to catch any errant prey. In the spring \Cref{fig:heatmap_total}(A) the consumer migration is very fast, reflecting relatively fast shift in light levels, with a much slower migration in the summer \Cref{fig:heatmap_total}(B,E). Moving the hands on the clock forward to the fall equinox, we see a different pattern \Cref{fig:heatmap_total}(C,F) compared to the spring equinox. The vertical migration is slower in the fall than the spring, which can be seen by the width of the intermediate states in \Cref{fig:heatmap_total}(C,F). An individual consumer is in less danger than in the spring, due to the decline in predator populations and rise in consumer populations \Cref{fig:long_term_populations}.

\subsection*{Feeding rates}
\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{plots/growth_short_rational.pdf}
\caption{Seasonal comparison of consumer \emph{(blue)} and predator, \emph{(red)} feeding patterns on March 22 (spring equinox) \emph{(A)}, 22 June (summer solstice) \emph{(B)} and 23 of September (fall equinox) \emph{(C)}}
\label{fig:growth_short_rational}
\end{figure}
\Cref{fig:growth_short_rational} shows the seasonal variations in the daily feeding patterns of consumers (blue) and predators (red), by zooming in on the spring equinox, summer solstice and fall equinox.

At all three points in time, consumers have a constant feeding level throughout the night \Cref{fig:growth_short_rational}. The main feeding time for predators is at dawn and dusk, with a slight peak during the day as well, \Cref{fig:growth_short_rational}. The length of predator feeding duration increases with the length of the night,  \Cref{fig:growth_short_rational}(B,C). Peak predator feeding activity decreases by a factor of 3/4 throughout the seasons, \Cref{fig:growth_short_rational}, reflecting lower maximal light levels.

The differentshort-term population growth patterns for complete rationality, bounded rationality and full irrationality are illustrated in \Cref{fig:pop_short_term}, by focusing on the patterns on summer solstice.
Looking at short-term population growth in the model with complete rationality and bounded rationality, \Cref{fig:pop_short_term}(A,B), the change in consumer and predator populations throughout a day is on the order of $10^{-3}$. In contrast, the model with constant behavior has rather large fluctuations of populations through a single day \Cref{fig:pop_short_term}(C).
