abstract = {The situation modeled is one in which a forager must expose itself to a greater risk of predation while foraging, and it adjusts foraging time adaptively to maximize fitness. The forager's behaviour results in a number of indirect effects between species; it causes interactions between the forager's predator and the forager's food; it causes predator self-limitation: and it may cause interactions between different food species. Simple models show that these trophically-mediated indirect effects theoretically can be comparable to or larger in magnitude than the direct interactions between adjacent trophic levels.-from Author},

@article{Preisser,
abstract = {Predation is a central feature of ecological communities. Most theoretical and empirical studies of predation focus on the consequences of predators consuming their prey. Predators reduce prey population densities through direct consumption (a density-mediated interaction, DMI), a process that may indirectly e the prey's resources, competitors, and other predators. However, predators can also affect prey population density by stimulating costly defensive strategies. The costs of these defensive strategies can include reduced energy income, energetic investment in defensive structures, lower mating success, increased vulnerability to other predators, or emigration. Theoretical and empirical studies confirm the existence of these induced costs (trait-mediated interactions, TMIs); however, the relative importance of intimidation (TMI) and consumption (DMI) effects remains an open question. We conducted a meta-analysis assessing the magnitude of both TMIs and DMIs in predator-prey interactions. On average, the impact of intimidation on prey demographics was at least as strong as direct consumption (63{\%} and 51{\%} the size of the total predator effect, respectively). This contrast is even more pronounced when we consider the cascading effects of predators on their prey's resources: density effects attenuated through food chains, while TMIs remained strong, rising to 85{\%} of the total predator effect. Predators can thus strongly influence resource density even if they consume few prey items. Finally, intimidation was more important in aquatic than terrestrial ecosystems. Our results suggest that the costs of intimidation, traditionally ignored in predator-prey ecology, may actually be the dominant facet of trophic interactions. {\textcopyright} 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Trophic cascades are textbook examples of predator indirect effects on ecological systems. Yet there is considerable debate about their nature, strength and overall importance. This debate stems in part from continued uncertainty about the ultimate mechanisms driving cascading effects. We present a synthesis of empirical evidence in support of one possible ultimate mechanism: the foraging-predation risk trade-offs undertaken by intermediary species. We show that simple trade-off behaviour can lead to both positive and negative indirect effects of predators on plant resources and hence can explain considerable contingency on the nature and strength of cascading effects among systems. Thus, predicting the sign and strength of indirect effect simply requires knowledge of habitat and resource use by prey with regard to predators' presence, habitat use and hunting mode. The synthesis allows us to postulate a hypothesis for new conceptualization of trophic cascades which is to be viewed as an ultimate trade-off between intervening species. In this context, different predators apply different rules of engagement based on their hunting mode and habitat use. These different rules then determine whether behavioural effects persist or attenuate at the level of the food chain.},

@article{kondoh,
abstract = {Food-chain length, the number of feeding links from the basal species to the top predator, is a key characteristic of biological communities. However, the determinants of food-chain length still remain controversial. While classical theory predicts that food-chain length should increase with increasing resource availability, empirical supports of this prediction are limited to those from simple, artificial microcosms. A positive resource availability-chain length relationship has seldom been observed in natural ecosystems. Here, using a theoretical model, we show that those correlations, or no relationships, may be explained by considering the dynamic food-web reconstruction induced by predator's adaptive foraging. More specifically, with foraging adaptation, the food-chain length becomes relatively invariant, or even decreases with increasing resource availability, in contrast to a non-adaptive counterpart where chain length increases with increasing resource availability; and that maximum chain length more sharply decreases with resource availability either when species richness is higher or potential link number is larger. The interactive effects of resource availability, adaptability and community complexity may explain the contradictory effects of resource availability in simple microcosms and larger ecosystems. The model also explains the recently reported positive effect of habitat size on food-chain length as a result of increased species richness and/or decreased connectance owing to interspecific spatial segregation. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Royal Society.},

@article{Khater2016,
abstract = {The complexity of behavioural interactions in predator-prey systems has recently begun to capture trait-effects, or non-lethal effects, of predators on prey via induced behavioural changes. Non-lethal predation effects play crucial roles in shaping population and community dynamics, particularly by inducing changes to foraging, movement and reproductive behaviours of prey. Prey exhibit trade-offs in behaviours while minimizing predation risk. We use a novel evolutionary ecosystem simulation EcoSim to study such behavioural interactions and their effects on prey populations, thereby addressing the need for integrating multiple layers of complexity in behavioural ecology. EcoSim allows complex intra- and inter-specific interactions between behaviourally and genetically unique individuals called predators and prey, as well as complex predator-prey dynamics and coevolution in a tri-trophic and spatially heterogeneous world. We investigated the effects of predation risk on prey energy budgets and fitness. Results revealed that energy budgets, life history traits, allocation of energy to movements and fitness-related actions differed greatly between prey subjected to low-predation risk and high-predation risk. High-predation risk suppressed prey foraging activity, increased total movement and decreased reproduction relative to low-risk. We show that predation risk alone induces behavioural changes in prey which drastically affect population and community dynamics, and when interpreted within the evolutionary context of our simulation indicate that genetic changes accompanying coevolution have long-term effects on prey adaptability to the absence of predators.},

abstract = {In inverted biomass pyramids (IBPs) prey are outnumbered by their predators when measured by biomass. We investigate how prey should behave in the face of danger from higher predator biomass, and how anti-predator behavior (in the form of vigilance) can, in turn, affect the predator–prey system. In this study, we incorporate anti-predator behaviors into a Lotka–Volterra predator–prey model in the form of fixed and facultative vigilance. Facultative vigilance models behavior as a dynamic foraging game, allowing us to assess optimal behavioral responses in the context of IBPs using a dynamical fitness optimization approach. We model vigilance as a tradeoff between safety and either the prey's maximum growth rate or its carrying capacity. We assess the population dynamics of predators and prey with fear responses, and investigate the role fear plays on trophic structure. We found that the ecology of fear plays an important role in predator–prey systems, impacting trophic structure and the occurrence of IBPs. Fixed vigilance works against IBP structure by always reducing the predator–prey biomass ratio at equilibrium with increasing levels of vigilance. Facultative vigilance can actually promote IBPs, as prey can now adjust their vigilance levels to cope with increased predation and the costs associated with vigilance. This is especially true when the effectiveness of vigilance is low and predators are very lethal. In general, these trends are true whether the costs of vigilance are felt on the prey's maximum growth rate or its carrying capacity. Just as the ecology of fear, when first introduced, was used to explain why top carnivores are rare in terrestrial systems, it can also be used to understand how big fierce predators can be common in IBPs.},

@article{bayesianmodel,
abstract = {To respond adaptively to fluctuations in risk, prey must sample to gain information on the current presence or absence of predators. Bayesian statistical decision theory provides a framework for modeling the effects of prey uncertainty about predation risk on prey behavior. The model predicts that due to prey uncertainty, prey should often stay in refuge long after predators have left an area. Prey behavioral time lags should depend on the quality of prey information about predation risk and on the costs and benefits of refuge use. Uncertainty can cause prey to always stay in refuge even though predators are only occasionally present. Observations on the responses of juvenile aquatic bugs, Notonecta hoffmani, to addition and removal of cannibalistic adults showed that prey behavioral time lags were longer when predator density was higher, prey were less hungry, and prey had lower escape ability. -from Author},

abstract = {The influence of optimal antipredator behavior of prey on predator-prey dynamics in a two-patch environment is studied. One patch represents an open habitat while the other is a refuge for prey. It is assumed that prey maximize their fitness measured by the instantaneous per capita growth rate. In each patch population dynamics is described by the Lotka-Volterra time continuous model. The refuge is characterized by its protectiveness which is inversely related to the predation risk for prey, and the dependence of population dynamics on protectiveness is studied. It is shown that adaptive behavior of prey changes qualitative properties of the underlying Lotka-Volterra model due to the appearance of a bounded attractor. Adaptive prey behavior does not lead to a stable equilibrium but to the reduction of population fluctuations. Dynamic consequences of a limited carrying capacity of the refuge are also considered. Low refuge carrying capacity leads to stability of predator-prey dynamics while stability is lost when the carrying capacity of the refuge is high. Lastly, it is shown that optimal antipredator behavior of prey leads to persistence and reduction of oscillations in population densities.},
